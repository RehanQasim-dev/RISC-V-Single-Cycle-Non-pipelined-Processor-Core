# RISC-V-Single-Cycle-Non-pipelined-Processor-Core
This is Single cycle RISC_V processor code written in System Verilog to run on FPGAs.Some of the important Instruction of the RISC-V architecture is supported here.
(a) R Type: ADD, SUB, OR, XOR, AND, SLT, SLTU.
(b) I Type: ADDI, ORI, ANDI, SLTI, LW.
(c) B Type: BEQ, BNE
Simulation file is also included to run this Processor on simulator software like Modelsim.
